# QuickChat
## A quick reference implementation of a workshop project

This is a fully peer-to-peer chat application. It uses a simple gossip protocol
for pee discover and message relay.

This repo is primarily a teaching tool. The goal is for the code to be easy to follow.
The code has a few unaccounted edge cases, and could be made more declarative and robust.
